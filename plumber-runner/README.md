# Plumber Runner

A retro-style side-scrolling runner game playable in the browser (desktop & mobile).

## How to Play

The screen scrolls automatically to the right. Your character runs forward on their own — your only control is **jumping**.

- **Tap / hold** to jump higher (variable jump height)
- You can **stand on top of pipes** — pipe tops are platforms!
- **Side collisions push you back** instead of killing you instantly
- You die when you get **crushed/squeezed** between obstacles:
  - Pushed off the left edge of the screen by a pipe
  - Squeezed between a bottom pipe and a ceiling pipe
  - Pinned between a ceiling pipe and the ground
- Your score increases each time you clear a pipe
- The game speeds up over time!

## Obstacle Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Bottom pipe | Rises from the ground — you can jump over **or stand on top** |
| Ceiling pipe | Hangs from the top — duck under or time your jump carefully |
| Pipe pair | Bottom + ceiling pipe together — navigate through the gap |

## Controls

| Platform | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Desktop  | `Space` or `Arrow Up` — hold for higher jump |
| Mobile   | Touch & hold anywhere on screen |
