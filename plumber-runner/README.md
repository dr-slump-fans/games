# Plumber Runner

A retro-style side-scrolling runner game playable in the browser (desktop & mobile).

## How to Play

The screen scrolls automatically to the right. Your character runs forward on their own — your only control is **jumping** to avoid pipes.

- **Tap / hold** to jump higher (variable jump height)
- Avoid all pipes — hitting one means Game Over
- Your score increases each time you clear a pipe
- The game speeds up over time!

## Controls

| Platform | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Desktop  | `Space` or `Arrow Up` — hold for higher jump |
| Mobile   | Touch & hold anywhere on screen |

## Running

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build step, no server, no CDN required.
